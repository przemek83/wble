## About project
 Library of useful Qt widgets. Created as a result of division of code of Volbx project and moving parts of it to independent library. Library contains:  
 + double slider
 + numeric filters (integer and double one)
 + string filter
 + date filter  
 + infinity progress bar
 + counter progress bar

## Getting Started
This section describes briefly how to setup the environment and build the project.

### Prerequisites
Qt in version 6.5 or greater, C++ compiler with C++17 support as a minimum and CMake 3.16+. 

### Building
Clone and use CMake directly or via any IDE supporting it. CMake should:
- configure everything automatically,
- compile and create binaries.

As a result of compilation, binary for simulations and binary for testing should be created.

**TIP**: remember to set properly `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` env variable. It should have Qt installation path to let CMake `find_package` command work.  

## Built with
| Tool |  Windows | Ubuntu |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS version | 10 22H2 | 24.04 |
| GCC | 13.1.0 | 13.2.0 |
| CMake | 3.30.2 | 3.28.3 |
| Git | 2.46.0 | 2.43.0 |
| Qt | 6.5.2 | 6.5.2 |
| Qt Creator | 10.0.2 | 10.0.2 |
| VS Code | 1.92.0 | 1.95.3 |

## Usage
The easiest way is to check examples subproject, where you can find how to create and interact with each widget included in this library.  
Alternatively, tests subproject can be checked. Usage also can be found in my other project called Volbx where widgets from this library are used.

## Widgets
### Double slider
![Alt text](DoubleSlider.png?raw=true "Double slider")  
Each handle can be moved independently. Check also Integer and Double filters, which are wrapping double slider into handy adjustable widgets.  
### Filters
Each filter widget inherits from `QGroupBox`. It means all filters can be checkable or not. Use standard `setCheckable()` to alter behavior.
#### Integer filter
![Alt text](IntegerFilter.png?raw=true "Integer filter not checkable")  
Wrapped double slider into adjustable widget. Dedicated for integer values.
#### Double filter
![Alt text](DoubleFilter.png?raw=true "Double filter not checkable")  
Wrapped double slider into adjustable widget. Dedicated for double values.
#### Date filter
![Alt text](DateFilter.png?raw=true "Date filter not checkable")  
Widget allowing to pick custom date range. An additional "Ignore data with empty dates" check box can be used to filter out data entries with empty dates.
#### String filter
![Alt text](StringFilter.png?raw=true "String filter not checkable")  
Widget allowing to pick multiple string values as filtered set. Additional checkbox "Select/Unselect all" for quick unchecking / checking all string values in filter.
### Progress bars
Widgets capable of showing progress of longer tasks. Can be used as a blend in widget or modal one. 
#### Infinity progress bar
![Alt text](InfinityProgressBar.png?raw=true "String filter not checkable")  
Can be used for tasks with unknown end time. The progress bar displays moving arcs until it is stopped or destroyed.
#### Counter progress bar
![Alt text](CounterProgressBar.png?raw=true "String filter not checkable")  
Can be used for tasks with known end time. The progress bar displays arc, which is moving from 0 towards 100 percent. In the middle, current percent is displayed.

## Testing
For testing purposes, the QtTest framework is used. Build the project first. Make sure that the `wble-tests` target is built. Modern IDEs supporting CMake also support running tests with monitoring of failures. But in case you would like to run it manually, go to the `build/tests` directory, where the‚Å£ binary `wble-tests` should be available. Launching it should produce the following output on Linux:
Example run:
```
$ ./wble-tests
********* Start testing of DoubleSliderTest *********
Config: Using QtTest library 6.5.2, Qt 6.5.2 (x86_64-little_endian-lp64 shared (dynamic) release build; by GCC 10.3.1 20210422 (Red Hat 10.3.1-1)), ubuntu 24.04
PASS   : DoubleSliderTest::initTestCase()
PASS   : DoubleSliderTest::testSettingCurrentValues()
PASS   : DoubleSliderTest::testEmittingCurrentMinChanged()

(...)

PASS   : UtilitiesTest::testGetSpanAngleCounterHalf()
PASS   : UtilitiesTest::testGetSpanAngleCounterFull()
PASS   : UtilitiesTest::cleanupTestCase()
Totals: 10 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 blacklisted, 0ms
********* Finished testing of UtilitiesTest *********

```
As an alternative, CTest can be used to run tests from the `build/tests` directory:
```
$ ctest
Test project <path>/wble/build/tests
    Start 1: wble-tests
1/1 Test #1: wble-tests .......................   Passed    0.11 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.11 sec
```
